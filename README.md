More of the Same (Ludum Dare 31)
===

My plan for the game is: there is only one stage, in which all the levels occur. When you reach the ending, you are warped to the beginning of the stage, so we never leave this screen. Each level adds one more obstacle to the stage, but nothing else is reset: enemies remain defeated, etc.

Bonus, if I have time: if you go back through the entrance of the stage, you are teleported to the end of the stage and the feature of that level disappears. This allows you to reset things by going back to the level they were introduced, removing the destroyed version, and go forward again to restore the undestroyed version.

But what kind of game shall it be? Platformer? Shooter? The above description would still fit anything.
