I've Seen This Room Before
===

You are in a room. The only room in the game. There are stairways going up and down, but somehow they lead back to this same room. The architect must have been a fan of Escher paintings.

As you walk up and down the stairs, you start to notice strange details. Was this wall here before? How come I've never noticed this shiny golden key, lying there on the floor, begging to be picked up?

It's a mystery. I suggest you continue going up. Or down; they both lead to the same room anyway.
